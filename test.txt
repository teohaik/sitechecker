The Yellow House (Dutch: Het gele huis), alternatively named The Street 
(Dutch: De straat),[1][2] is an 1888 oil painting by the 19th-century Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.

This title refers to the right wing of the 2 Place Lamartine, Arles, France, 
the house where, on May 1, 1888, Van Gogh rented four rooms. 

Van Gogh indicated that the restaurant, where he used to have his meals, was in the building painted pink close to the left edge of the painting (28 Place Lamartine). It was run by Widow Venissac, who was also Van Gogh's landlady, and who owned several of the other buildings depicted. To the right side of the Yellow House, the Avenue Montmajour runs down to the two railway bridges.[3] The first line, with a train just passing, served the local connection to Lunel, which is on the opposite (that is, right) bank of river Rhône. The other line was owned by the P.-L.-M. Railway Company (Paris Lyon Méditerranée)[4] In the foreground to the left, there is an indication of the corner of the pedestrian walk, which surrounded one of the public gardens on Place Lamartine. The ditch running up Avenue Montmajour from the left towards the bridges served the gas pipe, which allowed Van Gogh a little later to have gaslight installed in his atelier.[5]
